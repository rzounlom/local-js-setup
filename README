--both Git and NodeJS at the same time - run command: git --version && node --version (NOTE: the commands will be run in the order you call them)

Running the applicaion/files

1. install dependencies - run the command: npm install
2. run nodemon - open a terminal in the root of the project and run the following command: nodemon <fileName.js>
